Climate Compilation Projects
- This is a compilation of small projects done for Climate Modeling.
- All datasets used are sourced:
    - Hansen_Global and Jones_Global
    - NCEP Monthly Mean and Anomalies
    - NOAA Global Temperature SAT
- Results show:
    - data validity of both the Hansen and Jones data
    - Q-Q plot of the Jones data to show each month's standardized global temperature anomalies.
    - NCEP Monthly Mean and Anomalies data are used to show different modes of EOF and PC from 1948 to 2015
    - The Area Weighed Average from 1880 to 2017 of the Southern Hemisphere is computed using NOAA Global Temperature. Yearly and specified months are shown.
    - The De-trended Area Weighted Average Annual is also computed.
 
Climate Wildfire Dispersion
- Climate change caused by global warming increases seasonal wildfires, and wildfires cause air quality to drop in regional areas.
- Air quality (PM2.5) is analyzed from California wildfires relating to environmental causes.
    - The selected wildfires that had occurred from 2016 to 2017:: Thomas Fire, Rye Fire, Creek Fire, and Skirball Fire.
- Data is sourced from EPA: https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data
- Results are from 2016 to 2017 dataset:
    - Counties: Ventura, Santa Barbara, Colusa, and Monterey.
    - PC1 and EOF1 are produced for comparison.

 Two-Strain Viral
- This is a group project, and the results are produced by my partner (Laura Hu).
- The following results are the dynamics of an SIR Two-Strain Viral model.
- Parameters are chosen arbitrarily to express the dynamics of chaos.
